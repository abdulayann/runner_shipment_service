-- Script for transferring triangulationPartner data for Shipment entity

-- Step 1: Create the triangulation_partner_shipment table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS triangulation_partner_shipment (
    shipment_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    triangulation_partner BIGINT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (shipment_id, triangulation_partner),
    CONSTRAINT fk_triangulation_partner_shipment
        FOREIGN KEY (shipment_id) REFERENCES shipment_details(id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Step 2: Transfer data from shipment to triangulation_partner_shipment
INSERT INTO triangulation_partner_shipment (shipment_id, triangulation_partner)
SELECT shipment_details.id, shipment_details.triangulation_partner
FROM shipment_details
WHERE shipment_details.triangulation_partner IS NOT NULL;

-- Script for transferring triangulationPartner data for Consolidation entity

-- 1. Create the new table triangulation_partner_consolidation if not exists
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS triangulation_partner_consolidation (
    consolidation_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    triangulation_partner BIGINT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (consolidation_id, triangulation_partner),
    CONSTRAINT fk_triangulation_partner_consolidation FOREIGN KEY (consolidation_id) REFERENCES consolidation_details(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- 2. Insert data from the old triangulation_partner column into the new table triangulation_partner_consolidation
INSERT INTO triangulation_partner_consolidation (consolidation_id, triangulation_partner)
SELECT consolidation_details.id, consolidation_details.triangulation_partner
FROM consolidation_details
WHERE consolidation_details.triangulation_partner IS NOT NULL;
